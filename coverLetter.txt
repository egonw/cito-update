Dear editor,

please find enclosed my write up of "Two years of explicit CiTO annotations".

This article explores what happened after the launch of the pilot. It summarizes how
authors in the *Journal of Cheminformatics* used the pilot, shows citation annotations
are distributed with Wikidata, visualized with Scholia, discusses adoption outside BMC,
and ponders about what needs to happen next.

While adoption goes slowly, the uptake is now beyond the Journal of Cheminformatics
and in active use on preprint servers, including ResearchSquare, ChemRxiv, and
BioHackrXiv. And noting that CiTO has not gone unnoticed with the German company
Bayer indicates this is no longer merely an academic exercise.

The paper has been under development at https://github.com/egonw/cito-update and
I will have the submission system upload it to ResearchSquare.

The article is submitted as a Correspondence and I do not have funding to cover
the APC.

With kind regards,

Egon
